## Draft Outline
Post Outline: “Level Up: Leaderboards & Profiles Are Here!”

1. Hook / Opening
	•	Short, punchy line to grab attention.
	•	Examples:
	•	“Think you’re the best? Now prove it.”
	•	“Your scores just got a lot more exciting.”
	•	Optional: tease both the leaderboards and the profile page.

⸻

2. New Leaderboards
	•	Headline: “Compete with Everyone… or Just Your Crew”
	•	Subsections:
	1.	Global Leaderboard
	•	Compete with everyone playing the game.
	•	Show off your ranking for each game type.
	•	Example: “Climb the ranks and see if you can dethrone the top player.”
	2.	Private / Group Leaderboard (suggested names: Friends Leaderboard, Clan Leaderboard, Crew Challenge, Private League)
	•	Create a group with your friends.
	•	Invite other players and compete just within your circle.
	•	Example: “Challenge your squad and see who really rules.”

⸻

3. Player Profiles
	•	Headline: “Your Stats, Your Progress”
	•	Details to show off:
	•	Update your profile info (name, avatar, etc.)
	•	View your game stats: wins, high scores, rank, progress
	•	Track progress over time across different games
	•	Make it personal: “Your profile is now your leaderboard HQ.”

⸻

4. How It Works
	•	Keep it simple, maybe a 3-step visual flow:
	1.	Play games → your score is automatically tracked
	2.	Check leaderboards → see where you rank globally or in your group
	3.	Update your profile → track stats and show off your achievements

⸻

5. Social / Competitive Angle
	•	Highlight the fun/competitive side:
	•	“Bragging rights? Check.”
	•	“Friendly rivalry? Double-check.”
	•	Encourage users to create groups and invite friends.

⸻

6. Visuals / Screenshots
	•	Screenshot of global leaderboard
	•	Screenshot of private/friends leaderboard
	•	Screenshot of profile page with stats
	•	Optional: animated GIF of someone climbing a leaderboard

⸻

7. Call to Action
	•	Make it exciting and simple:
	•	“Update your profile, climb the leaderboard, and let the games begin!”
	•	Optional: “Create a private league and challenge your friends today.”

⸻

Extra Tips
	•	Keep the tone playful and competitive, not corporate.
	•	Use emojis sparingly if appropriate: 🏆🔥👑
	•	Lead with what players can do, not why it’s “good for them.”
