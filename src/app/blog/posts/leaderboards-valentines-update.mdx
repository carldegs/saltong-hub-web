We're here to interrupt your *bebe time* to share Saltong's Valentine's update! Along with a bunch of fixes and performance improvements, this update introduces **profiles**, **groups**, and **leaderboards** to make Saltong more social, more competitive, and a little more intense (in a fun way).

## Leaderboards are Here!

Leaderboards let you **create groups**, **invite your friends and family**, and compete on **daily rankings** across all Saltong games.

All games now support leaderboards:
- **Saltong Classic, Mini, and Max**  
  Rankings are based on how many turns you took to solve the puzzle. Fewer turns = higher rank.
- **Saltong Hex**  
  Rankings are based on your score at the end of the round.

Whether you’re racing to solve in 2 turns or grinding for a higher Hex score, every game now comes with bragging rights.

To create or join groups and leaderboards, a **Saltong account** is required, which you can create for free [here](https://saltong.com/auth?signup=1).

### Creating a Group

Making a group is quick and easy:

- Click **Create Group** from the sidebar  
- Or use the **Create Group** button on the Groups page  
- Or go directly to: [https://saltong.com/groups/create](https://saltong.com/groups/create)

You only need a **group name** to get started.

After creating a group, you’ll be taken to the group page where you can:
- Share an invite link
- Share a QR code
- Start inviting friends and family right away

###  Joining a Group

Joining a group is just as easy:

- Open the invite link or scan the QR code
- Confirm that you want to join the group
- You may be asked to complete your profile first (if you haven’t yet)

Once you’re in, you’ll land on the group page where you can:
- See the group leaderboard
- Check out other members
- Find your current rank and daily results

## Profiles

Profiles are required to join groups and appear on leaderboards.

A profile includes:
- An avatar
- A username
- A display name

This helps everyone recognize each other and makes leaderboards more fun and personal.

You’ll be prompted to complete your profile when accessing features that need it, like joining a group. You can edit your profile anytime from the **Settings** page.

We’ve also added a **Profile page**, where you can see all your stats in one place (and eventually, achievements).  
For now, profile pages are private and only visible to you, but we’ll announce it once public profiles are available.

## Other Fixes and Improvements

Some extra polish in this update:

- Updated the Saltong UI so the grid uses more screen space on mobile
- **Saltong Hex** now includes **6-letter rounds** to keep games interesting (and avoid running out of rounds)
- Faster load times across the site

## What’s Next?

Here’s what’s coming up:

- **Global leaderboards** so you can compete with everyone
- **Achievements and badges** you can earn and show off on your profile
- A **new game** is in the works 👀. More details soon!


Thanks for all the love and support. This Valentine’s update is about sharing the fun, the rivalry, and the wins.
