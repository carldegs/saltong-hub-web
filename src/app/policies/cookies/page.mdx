# Cookie Policy

**Last updated: January 10, 2026**

This Cookie Policy explains how Saltong ("Saltong," "we," "us," or "our") uses cookies and similar technologies to recognize you when you visit [https://saltong.com](https://saltong.com) and related pages (collectively, the "Website"). It describes the types of cookies we serve, why we use them, and the controls available to you.

We may combine cookie-derived information with other data about you and treat the aggregated information as personal data. Where required by law, we will request your consent before setting non-essential cookies.

## What are cookies?

Cookies are small data files stored on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website. They are widely used to make websites work or work more efficiently, as well as to provide reporting information.

- **First-party cookies** are set by the website owner (Saltong).
- **Third-party cookies** are set by parties other than the website owner (for example, analytics, advertising, or embedded content providers). These third parties can recognize your browser across different websites.

## Why do we use cookies?

We use first-party and third-party cookies for several reasons:

- **Essential operations:** Make the Website function, keep you signed in, route traffic, and prevent fraud.
- **Performance and functionality:** Improve the way the Website works and remember your preferences.
- **Analytics and customization:** Understand how visitors use the Website to improve features and content.
- **Advertising:** Deliver, measure, and (where permitted) personalize advertising through third-party partners.

## How can I control cookies?

You have the right to decide whether to accept or reject non-essential cookies. You can manage your preferences through the Cookie Consent Manager displayed in our notification banner and within the Website footer. Essential cookies are always on because they are required to deliver services you request.

You can also set or modify your browser controls to accept or refuse cookies. If you disable cookies, some features of the Website may not function properly.

## Types of cookies we use

### Performance and functionality cookies

These cookies enhance performance or remember custom settings. Without them, certain features (such as bot protection or saved preferences) may be unavailable.

Third parties may place cookies or web beacons on your device to show you ads on our Website or elsewhere online. These providers may use information about your visits to this and other sites to deliver relevant advertisements and measure campaign performance. The data collected does not enable us or them to identify you directly unless you choose to provide your details.

You can opt out of targeted advertising as described above (browser settings, industry tools, consent manager, or Global Privacy Control signals where supported).
