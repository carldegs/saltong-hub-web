### No Sale of Personal Information for Money

We do not sell your personal information in exchange for monetary consideration.

We retain personal data for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes described in this Privacy Policy, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law.

## Security

We implement technical, administrative, and physical security measures designed to protect personal data from unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. These measures include:

Saltong is based in [your jurisdiction/Philippines]. We may process, store, and transfer personal data in countries other than your own, including the United States and other jurisdictions where our service providers operate. These countries may have data protection laws that differ from those in your jurisdiction.

When we transfer personal data from the EEA, UK, or Switzerland to countries that do not provide an adequate level of data protection as determined by the European Commission or UK authorities, we implement appropriate safeguards, such as:

- Standard Contractual Clauses approved by the European Commission or UK authorities
- Adequacy decisions recognizing certain countries as providing adequate protection

## Do Not Track and Global Privacy Control

### Do Not Track (DNT)

Some browsers transmit "Do Not Track" (DNT) signals. There is no industry consensus on how to respond to DNT signals. We do not currently respond to DNT signals because we are awaiting the development of a common industry standard. However, you can use the cookie and opt-out controls described in this Policy to manage tracking.

### Global Privacy Control (GPC)

We recognize and honor Global Privacy Control (GPC) signals as an opt-out of the sale or sharing of personal information for cross-context behavioral advertising, where required by applicable law (including California, Colorado, Connecticut, and other states that recognize GPC).

To enable GPC, you can:
- Install a GPC-enabled browser extension
- Use a browser that supports GPC natively
- Learn more at [globalprivacycontrol.org](https://globalprivacycontrol.org/)

When we detect a GPC signal from your browser, we will apply your opt-out preference to that specific browser on that device. GPC signals are browser and device-specific, so you will need to enable GPC on each browser and device you use.
