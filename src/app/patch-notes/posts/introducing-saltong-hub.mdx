After years of sharing your daily word puzzle fix, Saltong is getting a huge, exciting upgrade! 

Starting January 1, 2026, the original Saltong site at saltong.carldegs.com will close its doors, and all the fun will move to our new, permanent address: **[Saltong Hub at saltong.com](https://saltong.com)**! 

But you don't have to wait! Saltong Hub is ready to play NOW in Open Beta. Start exploring the new features today, and help us find and fix any small issues before the official launch on January 1.


## What is Saltong Hub?

The old Saltong was simple, but it had a big problem: your progress and streaks were only saved on the one device and browser you were using. If your phone broke or you switched computers, your stats were gone forever.

Saltong Hub fixes this by moving your game into the cloud. This means everything is securely saved online under your account.

Here’s what that means for you:

✨ Key New Features:

- 🎮 All Games in One Place: Easily switch between Saltong (5-letter), Mini (4-letter), Max (6-letter), and Hex (our Filipino Spelling Bee) from one easy-to-use site.

- 📊 Stats You'll Never Lose: Track your progress, win streaks, and best scores. Everything is linked to your account, so your achievements are always safe.

- 🎨 Better Look and Feel: We’ve redesigned the site to be cleaner, faster, and much easier to play, especially on your mobile phone.

The most important change is the introduction of the **Saltong Account**. It's completely free and is the only way to save your progress and unlock the best new features.

### 🏛️ Access the Vault

Play all past Saltong puzzles, whenever you want. Missed a day? Want to practice with old challenges? When you create an account, The Vault gives you unlimited access to every single puzzle we’ve ever published. You'll never miss out again!

### ☁️ Play on Any Device (Seamless Sync)

Your game automatically saves online and syncs everywhere. Start a puzzle on your phone while commuting and finish it on your laptop when you get home. Your streaks and stats follow you perfectly.

### 🏆 More Features Coming Soon:

- **Earn Achievements**: Collect badges for hitting milestones, like getting your first win or a 7-day streak.
- **contribute**: Create private groups to see who gets the best scores each week.

## About Your Old Progress

I know this might be disappointing, but I need to be upfront: **progress from saltong.carldegs.com will NOT transfer to Saltong Hub.**

I understand how much effort you put into building those streaks, and I sincerely apologize.

Here’s the simple reason why: The old site couldn't save your progress online; it was only stored inside your browser. Since we're moving to a completely new system, there is no way to move that old, local data over.

Let's look ahead! Think of this as the perfect chance for a Fresh Start. New year, new features, and the chance to build a permanent streak that will be safe forever!

## What Happens to the Old Site?

The original site will stop hosting new puzzles and will automatically send you to the new home at [saltong.com](https://saltong.com).

## Found a Bug? Need Help?

Building Saltong Hub has also been a way for me to improve my web development skills, and I'm excited to keep learning and adding new features along the way.

I put a lot of work into making Saltong Hub the best word game experience. Since we're in the Beta testing phase, I especially need your help finding anything that's broken or confusing!
